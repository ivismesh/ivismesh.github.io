We created Arbor to visualize the MeSH database for the Information Visualization course. This project was done in collaboration with Karolinska Institue.


MeSH is a thesaurus containing several thousand medical terms and Arbor makes it easier for the users to be able to not only look up a medical term, but also see that terms' synonyms, broader- and narrower terms etc., making it easy to find connected terms.


Arbor is currently hosted at [ivismesh.github.io](http://ivismesh.github.io).
