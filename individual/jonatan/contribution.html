					<h5>Early Visualization Prototypes</h5>
					<p>
						At a very early stage of the project I made two visualization prototypes. The purpose of these prototypes were to 
						explore different ways of visualizing the data. Even though these prototypes were not used in the final visualization, 
						they contributed to our understanding of how the data was structured and how the data should be visualized.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first prototype used d3 and dagre-d3. This prototype visualized the data by merging certain nodes that were duplicated
						(nodes which were present at more than one location in the trees). It also had zoom and pan functionality implemented. 
						A screenshot of the prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/prototype_dagre_screen.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/prototype_dagre_screen.jpg</a><br>
						The working prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/">https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/dagre/</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The second prototype used only d3 and visualized the data as separate lists, showing the search term as well as 
						all broader terms. A screenshot of this prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/prototype_lists_screen.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/prototype_lists_screen.jpg</a><br>
						The working prototype is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/lists/</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Total time spent: 16 hours.
					</p>
					
					<h5>First Version of Final Visualization</h5>
					<p>
						After we had decided on some of the visual structures and overall design principles I developed the first version of what would 
						evolve into our final visualization. The following is the functionality which was implemented in the first version but not 
						kept in the final version:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Every node in the path to the search term was expanded. The node representing the search term was not 
								expanded.
							</li>
							<li>
								All trees had the same color.
							</li>
						</ul>
						The following is the functionality which was implemented in the first version and was kept in the final version:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The data is represented as a horizontal tree. Going from left to right. As you go from left to right 
								the nodes represents narrower terms.
							</li>
							<li>
								The root nodes are visualized as a vertical row of rectangles. Each root node has a separate color. 
								Each root node has its text label on the left side.
							</li>
							<li>
								Nodes can be expanded and contracted by clicking on them.
							</li>
							<li>
								When searching for a term, the paths to the nodes representing that term are expanded.
							</li>
							<li>
								Nodes which can be expanded to show additional nodes are filled (have a colored fill) and have 
								the text label on the left side. All other nodes are empty (have a white fill) and have the 
								text label on the right side. The exception to this is the root nodes.
							</li>
							<li>
								The nodes which represents the search term are slightly larger than the other nodes and have a glow. 
								The color of the glow is separate from the colors of the trees.
							</li>
							<li>
								The tree can be zoomed and panned.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Total time spent: 10 hours.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Additional Visualization Functionality</h5>
					<p>
						The following is a list of functionality which I developed for the visualization (after the final demo), in addition to the functionality 
						stated above:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The nodes representing the search term have bold text labels. The text labels of these nodes are also offset 
								slightly in the horizontal direction in order to add some space between the labels and the larger nodes.
							</li>
							<li>
								When you click on the text label of a node, a new search is initiated for that term.
							</li>
							<li>
								When you make a search, the "definition" panel is updated to show the definition of the search term. 
								The panel also displays a link which lets you search for that term in the pubmed database.
							</li>
							<li>
								The tree is zoomed and panned to fit on the screen when loading the page and when making a new search.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Total time spent: 16 hours (includes time spent fixing bugs).
					</p>
					
					<h5>Visualization Color Palettes</h5>
					<p>
						When it was decided that every tree in the visualization should have a separate color I made some research into 
						color theory. Since the visualization has 16 trees it would also need 16 different colors. I initially looked 
						into dividing the color circle into 16 different hues, while keeping the same saturation and value. However, 
						this did not yield the desired result as some of the colors were to similar to be able to be used as representations 
						of different categories. Also, some of the colors could not be displayed adjacent to each other sine they were too far 
						apart on the color circle.
					</p>
					<p>
						I therefore ended up using a combination of different hues, saturations and values. The final colors were selected 
						based on the following criteria:
						<ul>
							<li>
								The color has to have enough saturation that it is distinguishable from the white background.
							</li>
							<li>
								The color has to provide a good enough contrast to the black text which is displayed in front of it.
							</li>
							<li>
								The color has to be distinguishable from the other colors, when they are adjacent.
							</li>
							<li>
								The color should not be similar to the red glow color which is used to highlight nodes.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						Some of the tested color palettes as well as the final one is available at <a href="https://ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/color_palettes.jpg">ivismesh.github.io/individual/jonatan/color_palettes.jpg</a>
						The final color palette is the one at the top, which is also shown in comparison to some black text.
					</p>
					<p>
						Total time spent: 5+5 hours (research + testing).
					</p>
					
					<h5>Fixing Specific Bugs</h5>
					<p>
						When searching for a term which had a corresponding node in the second level of the tree, the node was not displayed. 
						Time spent fixing this bug: 3 hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						Total time spent: 3 hours.
					</p>
					
					<h5>Coordination and Project Management</h5>
					<p>
						I requested some of the project group meetings, which basically meant trying to get the whole group to agree on a meeting 
						time. For each of the project meetings we had I booked a study room at the main library. I also booked a meeting with the 
						teaching staff to ensure that we got feedback on the project. Before the final demo I performed a test of the 
						visualization on the Z1 server in the VIC studio.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is very difficult to estimate the total time spent on these tasks. Booking a study room only took a few minutes each time. 
						I have made 7 bookings. Getting project feedback took about 15 minutes (excluding travel time). Testing the demo on the Z1 
						server took about 10 minutes (excluding travel time). At one time I spent about 3 days (on and off) trying to set up a 
						project meeting.
					</p>
					<p>
						Total time spent: 1 hour (excluding travel time).
					</p>
					
					<h4>What I have learned</h4>
					<p>
						First and foremost, I feel that I have learnt how to make a good information visualization. This includes how to choose 
						an appropriate visual structure for a data set and how to map the data to that structure using d3. I have learnt a lot 
						about color theory; the color circle, different color models, analogous and complementary colors, but also how to apply 
						this in practice.
					</p>
					<p>
						When it comes to project management I have learnt that a project group with more than five members should appoint a leader. 
						I have also come to appreciate how important it is to write down as much as possible. Things like design descisions and 
						work distribution should definitely be written down.
