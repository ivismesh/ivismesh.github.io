					<h4>Contribution</h4>
					<p>I handled the contact with the KI University library and the UX testing we did with them - it is also my voice you hear in the video ~</p>
					
					<h5>KI contact person</h5>
					<p>I handled the contact with KI university library from the first e-mail forward - from booking of meetings to correspondence whenever anyone in the team needed something. I also prepared some scenarios for what we thought they needed before the first meeting - and then promptly revised them upon realizing they didnâ€™t want more advanced functionality but rather a more intuitive experience for first time users. On a side note I want to say they have been lovely to work with -</p>

					<h5>UX testing</h5>
					<p>Upon returning to KI for user testing we got to work with Daniel, their in-house expert on the same. He let us run our questionnaire we prepared beforehand by him and helped us approach test persons before letting us continue on our own in the afternoon.</p>
					
					<h5>Part of the design team</h5>
					<p>Precursor to the UX part mentioned above. After the first meeting we divided the group into two - with one handling data and ours design. We identified some of the early problems with the tree not actually being a tree - & made suggestions for what to unfold and whatnot during search as to minimize clutter.</p>
					
					<h5>Video presentation</h5>
					<p>At a late stage we realized non had been pinned for the voice acting and somehow I ended up practising my vowels during the better part of the weekend. I was told the end result was superb but personally I haven't quite gotten past the ordeal of hearing my own voice yet. Voice practise was fun however - </p>
					
					<h5>Presentation</h5>
					<p>I was part of the first presentation where we shared our initial findings and the final presentation where we showed our solutions to the set problems.</p>
					
					<h5>Junior programmer</h5>
					<p>Together with Sugandh I was tasked with developing one of the three rough prototypes - ours being the one testing branch logic. None of the code was used in the final version.</p>
					
					<h5>Group coordination & misc.</h5>
					<p>-</p>

					<h4>What I have learned</h4>
					<p>I learnt quite a bit on how to act as a liaison between a team and a customer during this course. I also found the morning we spent with Daniel educational (their in-house UX expert). I unashamedly took the opportunity to ask for a bit of advice and recommendations on literature. Apart from those rather novel experiences I have also got a new appreciation for the fact that reading in a clear voice can be difficult and that very well-intended and skilled people that believe they are coordinating can fail utterly to do so.</p>
