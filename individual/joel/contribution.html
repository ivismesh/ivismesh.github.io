					<h4>Contribution</h4>
					<h5>Header 2</h5>
					<p>What did you contribute? Name everything you did throughout the project, including development, research, presentations, website, writing, coordination, communication, etc. For each contribution, state the total time spent on task.</p>
					<h5>Channels of communication</h5>
					<p>In the beginning of the project I created most of the communication channels; I created a shared Drive folder and a Facebook group.
					I also created the group's Github and the accompanying webpage, where are visualizations are hosted. This did not take a lot of time, perhaps an hour.</p>

					<h5>Visualization contributions</h5>
					<p>I have of course attended meetings, both internal, with KI, and with Mario. So in terms of the visualization I have given input and feedback on the design.
					When it comes to programming I focused on the data; cleaning and putting it into CSV-files. Getting the right data turned out to be harder than I first
					thought. At first I tried to query the data from the MESH website using their SPARQL interface, but after a while I found that the data did not contain the
					scope notes, which is what we were after (we already had the tree numbers and names from another CSV file). While it might be
					possible to get the scope-notes using their interface, I found it too difficult given that I have never worked with SPARQL before, and their
					filesystem was pretty difficult to navigate. Instead, I found an ASCII file with all the relevant information. The only problem was that it was in
					an ASCII file, so I had to extract the relevant information. I therefore wrote a Java program which uses regular expressions to parse the file
					and extract whatever information we wanted, and putting that data into a CSV-file. Thus I managed to extract the scope notes from the ASCII-file and
					use it to provide an info-box in the visualization.</p>
